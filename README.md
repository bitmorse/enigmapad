#Enigmapad - an OTP secured communication device

- Secures your communication from eavesdropping with the single truly [unbreakable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_time_pad) cipher method OTP (when properly used)
- Enigmapad has a built in screen and keyboard and offers a chat like interface
- Works over any common audio line (telephone, walkie talkie, skype)
- Requires physical one time pad setup assisted by a RNG device of choice (e.g. geiger). Each pad is used once hence *One Time* Pad.
- Enigmapad not only secures the communication channel but also access to itself. Unauthorized physical access is prevented through a user passphrase. Enigmapad self destructs if it's tampered with ;)
- It's open source hardware, so build your own and modify!
- Enigmapad is currently in development, but watch this repo ;)
